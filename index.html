        <p>Uganda, located in East Africa, is known for its diverse landscapes, ranging from lush forests to the vast shores of Lake Victoria. Often referred to as the "Pearl of Africa," it boasts rich wildlife, including mountain gorillas in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park and numerous bird species. The country’s capital, Kampala, is vibrant, with a mix of traditional culture and modern amenities. Uganda's history is marked by a complex colonial past and significant political changes. The economy relies on agriculture, tourism, and services. Ugandan cuisine features staples like matoke (plantains) and posho (maize porridge). The warm, welcoming people and their rich cultural heritage, including music and dance, contribute to the country's unique charm.</p>
